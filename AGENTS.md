## Project

Spring Boot 3 + Kotlin demo built on a **fully reactive** stack, using the **functional routing (`coRouter` DSL)** style with separate Router and Handler classes.

**Stack:** Kotlin 2.1 · Spring Boot 3.4 · WebFlux · R2DBC · PostgreSQL · Flyway · Springdoc/OpenAPI · Testcontainers · JVM 21

**Data model:** `Enterprise` 1—N `Team`, `Team` N—N `User` via the `team_members` join table.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew clean build` | Spotless check, compile, test, package (full CI gate) |
| `./gradlew bootRun` | Start the application |
| `./gradlew test` | Run tests |
| `./gradlew spotlessApply` | Auto-format all sources |
| `./gradlew spotlessCheck` | Verify formatting (runs before `compileKotlin`) |

`compileKotlin` depends on `spotlessCheck` — **a formatting violation fails the build.** Run `./gradlew spotlessApply build` to auto-fix and build. Spotless uses `ktlint 1.5.0`.

## Agent behaviour rules

- **Be ultra concise.** In code, comments, documentation, and responses — say as little as possible to convey the point.
- **Never commit on behalf of the user.** Do not run `git commit` unless explicitly asked.
- **Write documentation and comments as correct content directly.** Do not add text explaining why something changed; the content stands on its own.
- **Match the surrounding code** — naming, idioms, comment density, formatting.

## Architecture

Request flow, one layer per responsibility:

```
Router (coRouter DSL + OpenAPI)  →  Handler (HTTP I/O, validation)  →  Service (business logic)  →  Repository (R2DBC)
```

- **Router** (`router/`) — `@Configuration` exposing a `coRouter { }` `@Bean`. Routes use `.nest("/x")`. Annotate with `@RouterOperations`/`@RouterOperation` so Springdoc generates OpenAPI docs. **Order routes carefully:** literal/longer paths before catch-alls (e.g. `GET("/{userId}/teams")` before `GET("/{id}")`).
- **Handler** (`handler/`) — `@Component`. Reads `ServerRequest`, validates the body, calls the service, builds `ServerResponse`. Keep business logic out. Use `awaitBody<T>()`, `bodyValueAndAwait(x)` (single), `bodyAndAwait(flow)` (stream).
- **Service** (`service/`) — `@Service`. Business logic and orchestration. Returns entities/DTOs or `Flow<T>`; throws `AppException.*`.
- **Repository** (`repository/`) — `CoroutineCrudRepository<Entity, Long>`. Derived queries return `Flow<T>` for collections, suspend for single rows.
- **Entity** (`domain/entity/`) — `data class` with `@Table` and nullable `@Id val id: Long? = null`.
- **DTO** (`dto/`) — request types (validated input) and projection types for composite/joined data (`EnterpriseWithTeams`, `TeamWithMembers`, `TeamSummary`). Simple resources are returned as their entity directly. No response envelope — see [Response shape](#response-shape-).


## Testing

- Integration tests extend `SharedTestContainers` (`src/test/.../shared/config/`), which starts **one reusable PostgreSQL Testcontainer** for the whole suite and wires R2DBC + Flyway via `@DynamicPropertySource`.
- Use `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)` with an autowired `WebTestClient` to exercise full routes (see `controller/UserControllerTest`).
- Assert HTTP status and JSON body (`jsonPath`); cover the success path and validation/error paths (e.g. 422 with `$.type`, `$.status`, `$.errors.<field>`).
- Router-level OpenAPI/Swagger wiring is covered by the `*SwaggerTest` classes in `router/`.
- Test names use backtick descriptions: `` `create user - returns 422 when required fields are blank` ``.
- Docker must be available to run the suite.

# Engineering audit digest

Apply the invariants below to all code you review, audit, or generate.
Detailed per-topic checklists live in the installed `audit` skill under
`references/` — by default `.agents/skills/audit/references/`. Read the
matching file (map at the bottom) before doing an in-depth audit.

## Invariants (always apply)

### Access & data security

- **Authorization** — every state-changing or sensitive action is permission-checked server-side at the point of action,
  not only in the UI or routing layer.
- **Authentication & sessions** — sessions are regenerated on login and invalidated on logout; credential and reset
  flows do not reveal whether an account exists.
- **IDOR** — any resource looked up by an identifier from the request is verified as owned by or visible to the current
  principal; a valid ID is not authorization.
- **Data exposure** — responses, errors, and logs contain only fields explicitly intended for the consumer; never whole
  models, stack traces, or PII by default.
- **Crypto & data protection** — passwords use adaptive hashing; tokens come from a CSPRNG; secret comparisons are
  constant-time; no homemade crypto.
- **Output encoding** — every user-controlled value rendered into HTML, JS, CSS, URLs, headers, or emails is encoded for
  that exact context.
- **Tenant isolation** — in multi-tenant code, every query, cache key, and background job is scoped by tenant; no
  implicit global reads.
- **CSRF** — state-changing endpoints authenticated by cookies verify a CSRF token or origin (not applicable to pure
  token-based APIs).
- **Mass assignment** — request data is never bound wholesale onto models; every binding site has an explicit,
  per-context allowlist of writable fields (allowlists, never denylists).

### Input, API & dependencies

- **Injection** — queries, shell commands, templates, and paths are built with parameterization or escaping APIs, never
  by concatenating input.
- **Configuration** — production config denies by default: debug off, CORS explicit, security headers present, cookies
  Secure/HttpOnly.
- **Secrets** — credentials live in env vars or secret managers; never hardcoded, logged, or committed; rotation is
  possible.
- **API contract & validation** — every input is validated at the boundary for type, bounds, and allowed fields; unknown
  fields are rejected or ignored explicitly.
- **File handling** — file paths are never derived from raw input; uploads are constrained by type, size, and storage
  location; served files cannot escape their root.
- **SSRF** — server-side requests to user-influenced URLs validate the destination against an allowlist; redirect
  targets count as destinations.
- **Parser differentials** — a gate must interpret input exactly as its consumer does: anchored matches, exact-host
  allowlists, validate the parsed object and pass that object on — never validate raw input and re-parse it.

### Correctness

- **Atomicity** — writes that must succeed together run in one transaction or have explicit compensation; partial state
  never survives a failure.
- **Idempotency** — any handler that can run twice (retries, webhooks, double submits) produces the same outcome as
  running once.
- **Background work** — jobs have bounded retries, dead-letter handling, and timeouts, and tolerate duplicate or
  out-of-order delivery.
- **State management** — no check-then-act on shared state without a lock, atomic primitive, or database constraint
  backing it.
- **Exception handling** — errors are handled or propagated, never swallowed; catches are narrow, causes preserved,
  resources released; HTTP boundaries return the status the condition means (404/401/403/422/409, never 200-with-error).
- **Discarded async work** — every promise, future, task, or publisher is awaited, returned, composed, or
  deliberately detached with error handling; a cold producer that is never subscribed silently never runs.

### Operability

- **N+1 queries** — never query inside a loop over a collection; load related data in bulk.
- **Observability** — every failure path logs with context; new endpoints and jobs emit enough signal for their failures
  to be visible in production.
- **Migration safety** — schema changes deploy without downtime: no long locks, destructive changes split across
  releases, rollback considered.
- **Resource limits** — all work driven by input size is bounded: pagination, body and upload caps, rate limits, no
  catastrophic regex.
- **Blocking I/O in async code** — code on a cooperative scheduler (event loop, coroutines, reactor) never blocks: no
  sync I/O, sleeps, or CPU-heavy work on the loop; blocking work is offloaded and outbound calls have timeouts.
- **Schema design** — relationships enforced by real foreign keys with deliberate ON DELETE; hot query paths backed
  by indexes; integrity rules (NOT NULL, unique, checks) live in the schema, not only in app validation.
- **Statelessness** — in replicated apps, state lives in process memory or local disk only if losing it is harmless
  and no peer replica needs it; sessions, counters, locks, uploads, and schedules live in shared stores.

## Deep checklists — what to read when

Read only the files matching what the code under audit does. Paths are
relative to the `audit` skill's `references/` directory (by default
`.agents/skills/audit/references/`); if a path does not resolve, locate the
`audit` skill folder in your skills directory and resolve from there:

(middleware, base classes, callers) before reporting it.
