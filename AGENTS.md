## Project

Spring Boot 3 + Kotlin demo built on a **fully reactive** stack, using the **functional routing (`coRouter` DSL)** style with separate Router and Handler classes.

**Stack:** Kotlin 2.1 · Spring Boot 3.4 · WebFlux · R2DBC · PostgreSQL · Flyway · Springdoc/OpenAPI · Testcontainers · JVM 21

**Data model:** `Enterprise` 1—N `Team`, `Team` N—N `User` via the `team_members` join table.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew clean build` | Spotless check, compile, test, package (full CI gate) |
| `./gradlew bootRun` | Start the application |
| `./gradlew test` | Run tests |
| `./gradlew spotlessApply` | Auto-format all sources |
| `./gradlew spotlessCheck` | Verify formatting (runs before `compileKotlin`) |

`compileKotlin` depends on `spotlessCheck` — **a formatting violation fails the build.** Run `./gradlew spotlessApply build` to auto-fix and build. Spotless uses `ktlint 1.5.0`.

## Agent behaviour rules

- **Be ultra concise.** In code, comments, documentation, and responses — say as little as possible to convey the point.
- **Never commit on behalf of the user.** Do not run `git commit` unless explicitly asked.
- **Write documentation and comments as correct content directly.** Do not add text explaining why something changed; the content stands on its own.
- **Match the surrounding code** — naming, idioms, comment density, formatting.

## Architecture

Request flow, one layer per responsibility:

```
Router (coRouter DSL + OpenAPI)  →  Handler (HTTP I/O, validation)  →  Service (business logic)  →  Repository (R2DBC)
```

- **Router** (`router/`) — `@Configuration` exposing a `coRouter { }` `@Bean`. Routes use `.nest("/x")`. Annotate with `@RouterOperations`/`@RouterOperation` so Springdoc generates OpenAPI docs. **Order routes carefully:** literal/longer paths before catch-alls (e.g. `GET("/{userId}/teams")` before `GET("/{id}")`).
- **Handler** (`handler/`) — `@Component`. Reads `ServerRequest`, validates the body, calls the service, builds `ServerResponse`. Keep business logic out. Use `awaitBody<T>()`, `bodyValueAndAwait(x)` (single), `bodyAndAwait(flow)` (stream).
- **Service** (`service/`) — `@Service`. Business logic and orchestration. Returns entities/DTOs or `Flow<T>`; throws `AppException.*`.
- **Repository** (`repository/`) — `CoroutineCrudRepository<Entity, Long>`. Derived queries return `Flow<T>` for collections, suspend for single rows.
- **Entity** (`domain/entity/`) — `data class` with `@Table` and nullable `@Id val id: Long? = null`.
- **DTO** (`dto/`) — request types (validated input) and projection types for composite/joined data (`EnterpriseWithTeams`, `TeamWithMembers`, `TeamSummary`). Simple resources are returned as their entity directly. No response envelope — see [Response shape](#response-shape-).

## Conventions

### Reactive — never block ⚠️

All APIs are non-blocking (coroutines over Reactor). R2DBC repositories and async clients are already non-blocking.

**Any blocking/synchronous call (blocking Java SDK, JDBC, etc.) inside a `suspend fun` must be wrapped in `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`.** Coroutines do not auto-detect blocking; an unwrapped blocking call stalls a WebFlux event-loop thread and degrades the whole server under load.

```kotlin
// ❌ blocks the event loop
suspend fun load(id: String) = SomeSdk.retrieve(id)

// ✅ runs on the IO pool
suspend fun load(id: String) = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { SomeSdk.retrieve(id) }
```

> `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` is a thread switch, **not** a transaction.

Audit: `blocking-call-audit`.

### Reactive — no fire-and-forget ⚠️

A cold producer that is never terminated **silently does nothing**:

- a `Flow` (repository/service return) that is never `.collect`/`.toList()`'d — the query never runs;
- a Reactor `Mono`/`Flux` (from interop) created but never `.await*()`'d, returned, or composed.

Terminate every producer: suspend `CoroutineCrudRepository` calls (`save`/`delete`) already execute; for a Mono use `.awaitSingleOrNull()`/`.awaitFirstOrNull()`; for a Flow use `.collect`/`.toList()` or return it in the chain. Avoid bare `.subscribe()` — it swallows errors and drops the reactive context (tx, correlation).

Audit: `fire-and-forget-audit`.

### N+1 queries ⚠️

**Never issue a DB call per item in a collection.** The pattern hides across method/layer boundaries — an outer query feeding a per-row inner query. Batch-fetch with an `…In(ids)` query, then join in memory.

The canonical correct shape lives in `EnterpriseService.searchByName` and `TeamService.findTeamsWithEnterpriseInfo`: fetch the collection → one `findAllByXIn` / `findAllById` per relation → `groupBy`/`associateBy` the FK, assembled in memory. Constant query count regardless of result size — not one-per-row.

```kotlin
// ❌ N+1 — 1 query for users + 1 query per user for posts.
//          25 users → 26 queries, and it grows with the result set.
val users = userRepo.findAll().toList()              // query 1: fetch users
users.map { user ->
    postRepo.findAllByUserId(user.id).toList()       // query 2..N+1: one per user 👈
}

// ✅ 2 queries total, regardless of result size.
val users = userRepo.findAll().toList()              // query 1: fetch users
val userIds = users.mapNotNull { it.id }
val postsByUser =
    postRepo.findAllByUserIdIn(userIds)              // query 2: batch-fetch ALL posts at once
        .toList()
        .groupBy { it.userId }                       // in-memory grouping — no extra query
users.map { user ->
    user.copy(posts = postsByUser[user.id].orEmpty())
}
```

Audit: `nplus1-audit`.

### Atomicity & transactions ⚠️

**Any service method doing 2+ DB mutations must be atomic.** A partial write (delete-then-failed-save, parent-saved-but-children-missing) is a bug.

- **Default:** `@Transactional` (`org.springframework.transaction.annotation`) on the **public** service method. It's proxy-based, so it is **silently ignored** on `private` methods and on **self-invocation** (a method calling another in the same class). Put the boundary on the public entry point.
- **For self-invoked or sub-block scopes**, use programmatic `TransactionalOperator`:
  ```kotlin
  class FooService(/* … */, transactionManager: ReactiveTransactionManager) {
      private val tx = TransactionalOperator.create(transactionManager)
      suspend fun bar() = tx.executeAndAwait { /* DB writes */ }
  }
  ```
- Reactive tx context propagates through the coroutine context, so `@Transactional` survives a `withContext`, but `withContext` itself provides no transactional guarantee — atomicity still requires `@Transactional` or `TransactionalOperator`.
- **Keep external calls (HTTP, email, object storage, payment SDKs) OUTSIDE the transaction** — a DB tx can't roll them back and they shouldn't hold a connection. Do reads first, open the tx for DB writes only, run side effects after commit. Make external mutations **idempotent** (deterministic keys, persisted external ids) so a crash between the call and the commit reconciles on retry instead of duplicating.

Audit: `atomicity-audit`.

### Idempotency — replay-safe writes ⚠️

**A retried write must not duplicate work.** Retries are normal (client timeout, proxy, provider redelivery); design every unsafe operation to be replay-safe.

- **Create-once invariants get a DB `UNIQUE` constraint.** An app-level pre-check (`findByX != null → Conflict`) alone races under concurrent requests. Catch `DataIntegrityViolationException` and rethrow as `AppException.Conflict(key, args, e)` — the canonical shape is `uq_team_members_team_user` + `UserService.assignToTeam`.
- **External mutations** (none yet): a deterministic idempotency key or a persisted external id, so a crash-then-retry reconciles instead of duplicating — see [Atomicity & transactions](#atomicity--transactions-).
- **Webhooks** (none yet): dedupe provider redelivery by event id (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING` inbox) before processing.

Audit: `idempotency-audit`.

### Error handling

Throw `AppException.*` (`exception/AppException.kt`) — i18n-aware, user-safe message keys resolved by the global `ApplicationExceptionHandler`.

**Why a marker type:** message safety can't be judged from the text — a built-in exception (e.g. `RuntimeException`) may carry SQL, paths, or internals. `AppException` is the *only* type whose message reaches the client (an allowlist); every other exception's message is suppressed by default (fail closed). Built-ins are at most mapped to a status code — never to their message.

| Exception | Status |
|---|---|
| `AppException.BadRequest(key, args)` | 400 |
| `AppException.Unauthorized(key, args)` | 401 |
| `AppException.Forbidden(key, args)` | 403 |
| `AppException.NotFound(key, args)` | 404 |
| `AppException.Conflict(key, args)` | 409 |
| `AppException.ValidationErrors(fieldErrors, summaryKey)` | 422 |

- `key` is an i18n message key; `args` fills `{0}`, `{1}` placeholders (e.g. `AppException.NotFound("error.user.not.found", arrayOf(id))`).
- Pass the original `cause` when wrapping a caught error: `AppException.Conflict(key, args, e)` (see `UserService.assignToTeam`).
- Use `ValidationErrors` for multi-field business rules that Bean Validation annotations can't express (cross-field, DB-uniqueness).
- `ConstraintViolationException` / `WebExchangeBindException` → 422 with per-field errors; `AccessDeniedException`, `ServerWebInputException`, `ResponseStatusException` are handled and their internals suppressed. **Don't** build ad-hoc error responses — extend the handler instead.
- All errors return an **RFC 9457 problem detail** (`application/problem+json`): `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail` (the resolved message), `instance` (request path), plus extensions `correlationId` and `errors?`. Framework/5xx messages are generic to avoid leaking internals; the `correlationId` is logged with every failure.
- `type` is derived from the message key (`error.username.taken` → `/errors/username-taken`) for `AppException.*` and validation errors; other errors keep `about:blank`. **Message keys are therefore part of the API contract — renaming one changes its `type` URI.**

Audit: `exception-audit`.

### Mass assignment — never trust client-controlled input ⚠️

A client can put any value in a request body. **Accept only fields it's legitimately allowed to set; derive or authoritatively fetch everything else server-side.** If a field would let the client influence a server-owned value, it doesn't belong in the request DTO.

Never accept from the client — set server-side: `id`, state/role/privilege flags (`role`, `status`, `verified`, …), timestamps (`createdAt`/`updatedAt`), and computed values. Current request DTOs (`UserRequest`, `TeamRequest`, `EnterpriseRequest`) correctly exclude `id` — entities default `@Id` to `null` and the DB assigns it.

Audit: `mass-assignment-audit` (privilege/bookkeeping fields); ownership/identity ids → [Security: IDOR](#security-idor-).

### Security: IDOR ⚠️

**Ownership/identity ids** (`userId`, `ownerId`, an `enterpriseId` used for authorization) are the ownership special case of the same never-trust-client-input rule ([Mass assignment](#mass-assignment--never-trust-client-controlled-input-)) — the variant that depends on **who the caller is** — they must come from the authenticated principal, not the payload, and existence of a row must never imply authorization (ids are sequential `BIGINT`, hence enumerable).

> This project has **no authentication yet.** Until a principal exists there is nothing to enforce ownership against. When authentication is added: any handler taking a resource id must verify the resource belongs to the authenticated principal — derive the principal from the auth context, scope the query (`findByIdAndOwnerId…`) or assert ownership, and throw `AppException.Forbidden` on mismatch (or `NotFound` when existence itself is sensitive).

Audit: `idor-audit` (forward-looking until auth lands — inventories the id-taking surface).

### Response shape ⚠️

**Return the resource representation directly and let the HTTP status carry the semantics — no success envelope.** Returning an `@Table` entity directly is fine *when it carries no sensitive data* (`bodyValueAndAwait(user)`); the moment an entity would expose a secret or internal field, introduce a scoped `*Response` DTO (or a projection) instead of the entity.

- **Status carries meaning:** `200` read, `201` created (returns the created resource), `201`/`204` with **no body** for a no-payload action (e.g. `assignToTeam`). Errors go through `ApplicationExceptionHandler` (RFC 9457 problem detail — see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
- **No success envelope** (`DataResponse`/`{data,message}`). The one exception is a *paginated* collection, which may wrap items with page metadata — not yet used here.
- **Never expose secrets/internal fields ⚠️:** credentials/secrets (`passwordHash`, tokens, `*Secret`) or internal bookkeeping (`deletedAt`, audit columns, internal flags) must never reach a serialized response. If an entity gains such a field, stop returning the entity and add a scoped `*Response` DTO. Don't leak another principal's PII (`email`/`phoneNumber`).
- **Composite/joined data** uses a projection DTO (`EnterpriseWithTeams`, `TeamWithMembers`, `TeamSummary`) — there's no single entity to return.

Audit: `response-exposure-audit`.

### Observability — logging

Failures must surface, and logs must not leak data.

- Logging uses `io.github.oshai.kotlinlogging.KotlinLogging` (`private val logger = KotlinLogging.logger {}`). **Never** `println` / `System.out`.
- **Don't swallow exceptions** — a blind `catch { }`, a catch returning `null`/a default without logging, or a reactive `onErrorResume { Mono.empty() }` hides a real failure. Either let it reach `ApplicationExceptionHandler` or log it with its cause.
- The central handler logs 4xx-shaped failures at `warn` and 5xx at `error`, each prefixed with the `correlationId`. Match those levels.
- **Never log secrets or PII** — no tokens/passwords, no `email`/`phoneNumber`, no full request/DTO bodies.

Audit: `observability-audit`.

### Stateless architecture ⚠️

Keep instances stateless so the app can run behind a load balancer (any request may hit any instance). The concrete shared store / scheduler / lock is a deployment choice — this project stays infra-agnostic.

- **No authoritative or consistency-critical state in process** — if losing it on restart, or two instances disagreeing, would be incorrect (not just a cache miss), it belongs in the DB or a shared store. A short-TTL local cache of DB-backed data is fine.
- **`@Scheduled` fires on every instance** — if more than one runs, in-process schedules duplicate work. Drive periodic work from a single external trigger or guard it with a shared lock.

Audit: `stateless-audit`.

### Null handling

Prefer a safe call over a redundant null-check-then-deref: `user?.email != null`, not `user != null && user.email != null`.

**Positive checks only.** Keep the expanded form for `== null` and negated comparisons — collapsing flips the result when the receiver is null (e.g. `team != null && team.name != EXPECTED` must stay expanded, or the body NPEs). Review convention; no ktlint rule enforces it.

### Validation & i18n

- Request DTOs carry Jakarta Bean Validation annotations with i18n message keys: `@field:NotBlank(message = "{user.name.required}")`.
- Handlers validate via `validator.validateAndThrow(request.awaitBody<T>(), request.locale())` (see `extension/ValidatorExtensions.kt`). This sets the locale, validates, and throws `ConstraintViolationException` on failure.
- Messages live in `messages.properties` (English) and `messages_fr.properties` (French). Add every new key to **both**.
- Clients select language with the `Accept-Language: fr` header; default is English.

## Database & migrations

All schema changes go through **Flyway** migrations in `src/main/resources/db/migration/` — never alter the DB directly. Flyway applies migrations on startup.

- **Before adding a migration:** list `src/main/resources/db/migration/` for the highest `V<N>` and name yours `V<N+1>__<description>.sql`.
- **Primary keys:** `id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY`, always first.
- **Foreign keys:** named constraint (`fk_<table>_<ref>`); index the FK column when it drives lookups.
- **`ON DELETE CASCADE`:** only on join/association tables, where a row has no meaning without its parent (e.g. `team_members` → `teams`/`users`). Keep the default RESTRICT for parents that own substantial entities (e.g. `teams` → `enterprises`) so a single delete can't silently wipe a subtree.
- **Enums:** `VARCHAR(N) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'X' CHECK (col IN (...))` — no PostgreSQL `ENUM` type.
- Prefer `NOT NULL` + `DEFAULT`; allow nullable only when absence is meaningful.
- `COMMENT ON COLUMN` for any non-obvious column.
- **Soft delete** (if introduced): nullable `deleted_at TIMESTAMP` as the last column, with a partial index `WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL` and a comment.
- Map snake_case columns to camelCase properties.

Audit: `migration-safety-audit`.

## Testing

- Integration tests extend `SharedTestContainers` (`src/test/.../shared/config/`), which starts **one reusable PostgreSQL Testcontainer** for the whole suite and wires R2DBC + Flyway via `@DynamicPropertySource`.
- Use `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)` with an autowired `WebTestClient` to exercise full routes (see `controller/UserControllerTest`).
- Assert HTTP status and JSON body (`jsonPath`); cover the success path and validation/error paths (e.g. 422 with `$.type`, `$.status`, `$.errors.<field>`).
- Router-level OpenAPI/Swagger wiring is covered by the `*SwaggerTest` classes in `router/`.
- Test names use backtick descriptions: `` `create user - returns 422 when required fields are blank` ``.
- Docker must be available to run the suite.

## Skills (audits)

On-demand audits that verify the ⚠️ rules above live in `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (Copilot reads them there natively; Claude Code reads them via the `.claude/skills` symlink). They are **not** auto-loaded — invoke the relevant one when reviewing or adding code. `review-conventions` routes a diff to the right subset; `audit` runs a whole bundle (by `tags:`) over a chosen scope. Each skill is tagged `security` / `correctness` / `scaling` / `db` / `meta` — `audit list` prints the live bundle map.

The scope is the last token and sets where the skills look, not which skills run. With no scope token, only the current diff is audited, so a clean tree yields nothing. A layer name (`service`, `handler`, …) or a path audits every file there, whole files. `.` audits the entire repo regardless of git history. Example: `audit all .` runs every audit skill over the whole codebase.
